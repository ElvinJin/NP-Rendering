1.Implementation

UI.m: the UI interface of our application.

(i)cartoon(all the functions of cartoon are included in UI.m): 
Convert the original rgb image into LAB color and norm the L channel to [0,1]-----------------converLAB()
Implement Biateral Filter(Using the code online)----------------------------------------------bfilter2()
Perform the edge extraction in difference-of-Gaussians and smoothe the dege using tanh()------DoG() smooth()
Perform the quantization by seperate he lightness level and smooth them-----------------------quantization()
Compose the quanticized result and the edge

(ii)pencil
Based on the algorithm on the paper, we implemented following functions:
Main file for running texture rendering process, it includes the texture rendering algorithm--sketch.m
Create strokes of 8 different directors-------------------------------------------------------directions(sketchSize)
Create the magnitude map for all the directions-----------------------------------------------magnitudeMap(G, gradientImg)
Create the new probability distribution of the pixel values-----------------------------------createMixedP

(iii)iOS app using external framework
In the folder /iOS there is our iOS project file for this project which uses external framework. Its effects are included in the framework running on GPU of iPhone. We tryed writing our own effect but we found it needs to use openGV ES, which we cannot handle that within this limited time, so we give up writing our own filter.
